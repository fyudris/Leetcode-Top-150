# Leetcode-Top-150

Welcome to the Leetcode-Top-150 repository! This project is dedicated to solving and documenting my progress and solutions for the top 150 frequently asked Leetcode problems, focusing on algorithmic problem-solving and coding best practices.

## Purpose
The aim of this repository is to:
* Practice and improve problem-solving skills.
* Understand and implement optimal solutions for popular Leetcode problems.
* Serve as a reference for preparing technical interviews.
* Build a structured collection of solutions in various programming languages (e.g., C, Python, Java, etc.).

## How to Use the Structure
1. __Build all problems__
```
make
```
Compiles all problem into the `build\` directory
2. __Build a specific problem__
```
make problems/arrays/two_sum
```
Compiles only the `two_sum` problem.
3. __Run a specific problem__
```
./build/two_sum
```
4. __Clean compiled files__
make clean

## Benefits of This Structure
* __Modular Design__: Each problem is self-contained and easily maintainable.
* __Centralized Build System__: A single Makefile simplifies building and testing.
* __Scalability__: You can add new problems by creating a new directory and updating the PROBLEMS list in the Makefile.

## Problem Format
Each problem solution follows this format:
```
Problem Title: <Problem Name>
Difficulty: <Easy | Medium | Hard>

Problem Description:
<Problem description or link to the Leetcode problem>

Time Complexity:
<O notation for time complexity>

Solution/Code:
<Code Implementation>
<Explanation of the approach and reasoning>
```
